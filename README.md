## Learning FastAPI

A simple project to learn the fundamentals of FastAPI.
While I already completed my first projects with Flask, I wanted to try FastAPI and async programming in Python.
Async programming is a new concept for me, and I am excited to learn it.
```Work in Progress``` I'll be adding features while learning.

## Technologies
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Uvicorn: ASGI server for Python

## Run
After cloning this repository, you can run the following commands to install the dependencies and run the FastAPI application:

```bash
python3 -m pip install fastapi
pip instal uvicorn
uvicorn myapi:app --reload
```
## Test
Open  http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your navigator. You should see the FastAPI welcome page.
